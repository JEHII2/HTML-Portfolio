<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Originally from Chicago, IL. Joe Hardy is an upcoming Web Developer. He has a Master of Business Administration emphasis
   in Entrepreneurial Leadership from William Woods University located in Fulton, Missouri.  Though he has over 15 years 
   combined in Consulting, Law Enforcement, and Higher Education, he decided to go in a different direction.  The Information 
   Technology field continues to grow year after year and with its projected growth, Joe thought it would be beneficial to 
   pick up a new set of skills. This website will house a compilation of all his projects showing his progress during the 
   learning journey.</p>
