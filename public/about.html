<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Originally from Chicago, IL. Joe Hardy is an upcoming Web Developer. He has a Master of Business Administration emphasis
   in Entrepreneurial Leadership from William Woods University located in Fulton, Missouri.  Though he has over 12+ years 
   combined in the law enforcement and higher education fields, he decided to go in a different direction.  The Information 
   Technology field continues to grow year after year and with its projected growth, Joe thought it would be beneficial to 
   pick up a new set of skills. This website will house a compilation of all his projects showing his progress during the 
   learning journey.</p>
